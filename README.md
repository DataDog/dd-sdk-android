# Datadog SDK for Android and Android TV

> A client-side Android and Android TV library to interact with Datadog.

## Getting Started

### Log Collection

See the dedicated [Datadog Android Log Collection documentation](http://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/android) to learn how to forward logs from your Android or Android TV application to Datadog.

### Real User Monitoring

See the dedicated [Datadog Android RUM Collection documentation](https://docs.datadoghq.com/real_user_monitoring/android/) to learn how to send RUM data from your Android or Android TV application to Datadog.

## Log Integrations

### Timber

If your existing codebase is using Timber, you can forward all those logs to  Datadog automatically by using the [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-timber/README.md).

## RUM Integrations

### Coil

If you use Coil to load images in your application, take a look at Datadog's [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-coil/README.md).

### Fresco

If you use Fresco to load images in your application, take a look at Datadog's [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-fresco/README.md).

### Glide

If you use Glide to load images in your application, take a look at Datadog's [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-glide/README.md).

### Jetpack Compose

If you use Jetpack Compose to load images in your application, take a look at Datadog's [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-compose/README.md).

### Picasso

If you use Picasso, let it use your `OkHttpClient`, and you can get RUM and APM information about network requests made by Picasso.

```kotlin
        val picasso = Picasso.Builder(context)
                .downloader(OkHttp3Downloader(okHttpClient))
                // …
                .build()
        Picasso.setSingletonInstance(picasso)
```

### Retrofit

If you use Retrofit, let it use your `OkHttpClient`, and you can get RUM and APM information about network requests made with Retrofit.

```kotlin
        val retrofitClient = Retrofit.Builder()
                .client(okHttpClient)
                // …
                .build()
```

### Apollo (GraphQL)

If you use Apollo, let it use your `OkHttpClient`, and you can get RUM and APM information about all the queries performed through the Apollo client.

```kotlin
        val apolloClient =  ApolloClient.builder()
                 .okHttpClient(okHttpClient)
                 .serverUrl(<APOLLO_SERVER_URL>)
                 .build()
```

## Looking up your logs

When you open your console in Datadog, navigate to the [Log Explorer][1]. In the search bar, type `source:android`. This filters your logs to only show the ones coming from Android or Android TV applications.

## Looking up your spans

When you open your console in Datadog, navigate to [**APM** > **Services**][2]. In the list of services, you can see all your Android and Android TV applications (by default, the service name matches your application's package name, for example: `com.example.android`). You can access all the traces started from your application.

## Looking up your RUM events

When you open your console in Datadog, navigate to the [RUM Explorer][3]. In the side bar, you can select your application and explore Sessions, Views, Actions, Errors, Resources, and Long Tasks.
