# Datadog SDK for Android

> A client-side Android library to interact with Datadog.

## Getting Started

### Log Collection

See the dedicated [Datadog Android log collection documentation](http://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/android) to learn how to forward logs from your Android application to Datadog.

### Migrating from earlier versions

If you are using SDK version `0.2.5` or lower, take a look at the [Migration Guide](docs/Migrating_To_1.0.0.md). There are some breaking changes introduced in version `1.0.0`.

### Integrating with Timber

If your existing codebase is already using Timber, you can migrate to Datadog easily by using the [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-timber/README.md).

### Integrating with Coil

If you use Coil to load images in your application, take a look at Datadog's [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-coil/README.md).

### Integrating with Fresco

If you use Fresco to load images in your application, take a look at Datadog's [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-fresco/README.md).

### Integrating with Glide

If you use Glide to load images in your application, take a look at our [dedicated library](dd-sdk-android-glide/README.md).

### Integrating with Picasso

If you use Picasso, let it use your `OkHttpClient`, and you'll get RUM and APM information about network requests made by Picasso.

```kotlin
        val picasso = Picasso.Builder(context)
                .downloader(OkHttp3Downloader(okHttpClient))
                // â€¦
                .build()
        Picasso.setSingletonInstance(picasso)
```

## Looking up your logs

When you open your console in Datadog, navigate to the Logs section. In the search bar, type `source:mobile`. This filters your logs to only show the ones coming from mobile applications (Android and iOS).
