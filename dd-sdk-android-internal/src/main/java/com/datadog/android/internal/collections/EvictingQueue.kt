/**
 * A bounded queue that automatically evicts the oldest elements when new elements are added beyond its maximum capacity.
 *
 * This implementation delegates all [Queue] operations to an underlying [LinkedList]. It provides a FIFO (first-in, first-out)
 * behavior with a fixed maximum size. When new elements are added and the queue is at capacity, the oldest element is evicted.
 *
 * @param T the type of elements held in this queue.
 * @param maxSize the maximum number of elements the queue can hold. Must be greater than or equal to 0.
 *                The default value is [Int.MAX_VALUE], which effectively means there is no practical bound.
 * @param delegate the underlying [LinkedList] that stores the elements and to which all [Queue] operations are delegated.
