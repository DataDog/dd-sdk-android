# Android Trace Collection

Send [traces][1] to Datadog from your Android applications with [Datadog's `dd-sdk-android` client-side tracing library][2] and leverage the following features:

* Create custom [spans][3] for operations in your application.
* Add `context` and extra custom attributes to each span sent.
* Optimized network usage with automatic bulk posts.

## Setup

1. Add the Gradle dependency by declaring the library as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```conf
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/datadog/datadog-maven" }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android:x.x.x"
    }
   ```

2. Initialize the library with your application context, tracking consent, and the [Datadog client token][4] and Application ID generated when you create a new RUM application in the Datadog UI (see [Getting Started with Android RUM Collection][7] for more information). For security reasons, you must use a client token: you cannot use [Datadog API keys][5] to configure the `dd-sdk-android` library as they would be exposed client-side in the Android application APK byte code. For more information about setting up a client token, see the [client token documentation][4]:

   {{< tabs >}}
   {{% tab "US" %}}
   ```kotlin
    class SampleApplication : Application() {
        override fun onCreate() {
            super.onCreate()
            val configuration = Configuration.Builder().build()
            val credentials = Credentials(<CLIENT_TOKEN>,<ENV_NAME>,<APP_VARIANT_NAME>,<APPLICATION_ID>)
            Datadog.initialize(this, credentials, configuration, trackingConsent)
        }
    }
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{% tab "EU" %}}
   ```kotlin
   class SampleApplication : Application() {
       override fun onCreate() {
          super.onCreate()
          val configuration = Configuration.Builder()
             .useEUEndpoints()
             .build()
          val credentials = Credentials(<CLIENT_TOKEN>,<ENV_NAME>,<APP_VARIANT_NAME>,<APPLICATION_ID>)
          Datadog.initialize(this, credentials, configuration, trackingConsent)
       }
   }
   ```
   {{% /tab %}}
   {{< /tabs >}}
   
   To be compliant with the GDPR regulation, the SDK requires the tracking consent value at initialization.
   The tracking consent can be one of the following values:
   * `TrackingConsent.PENDING`: The SDK starts collecting and batching the data but does not send it to the data
     collection endpoint. The SDK waits for the new tracking consent value to decide what to do with the batched data.
   * `TrackingConsent.GRANTED`: The SDK starts collecting the data and sends it to the data collection endpoint.
   * `TrackingConsent.NOT_GRANTED`: The SDK does not collect any data. You will not be able to manually send any logs, traces, or
     RUM events.

   To update the tracking consent after the SDK is initialized, call: `Datadog.setTrackingConsent(<NEW CONSENT>)`.
   The SDK changes its behavior according to the new consent. For example, if the current tracking consent is `TrackingConsent.PENDING` and you update it to:
   * `TrackingConsent.GRANTED`: The SDK sends all current batched data and future data directly to the data collection endpoint.
   * `TrackingConsent.NOT_GRANTED`: The SDK wipes all batched data and does not collect any future data.

   Note that in the credentials required for initialization, your application variant name is also required. This is important because it enables  the right proguard `mapping.txt` file to be automatically uploaded at build time. This allows a Datadog dashboard to de-obfuscate the stack traces.

   Use the utility method `isInitialized` to check if the SDK is properly initialized:

   ```kotlin
    if(Datadog.isInitialized()){
        // your code here
    }
   ```
   When writing your application, you can enable development logs by calling the `setVerbosity` method. All internal messages in the library with a priority equal to or higher than the provided level are then logged to Android's Logcat:
   ```kotlin
   Datadog.setVerbosity(Log.INFO)
   ```

3. Configure and register the Android Tracer. You only need to do it once, usually in your application's `onCreate()` method:

    ```kotlin
    val tracer = AndroidTracer.Builder().build()
    GlobalTracer.registerIfAbsent(tracer)
    ```

4. (Optional) - Set the partial flush threshold. You can optimize the workload of the SDK if you create a lot of spans in your application, or on the contrary very few of them. The library waits until the number of finished spans gets above the threshold to write them on disk. A value of `1` writes each span as soon as its finished.

    ```kotlin
    val tracer = AndroidTracer.Builder()
        .setPartialFlushThreshold(10)
        .build()
    ```

5. Start a custom span using the following method:

    ```kotlin
    val tracer = GlobalTracer.get()
    val span = tracer.buildSpan("<SPAN_NAME>").start()
    // Do something ...
    // ...
    // Then when the span should be closed
    span.finish()

    ```
6. To use scopes in synchronous calls:
   ```kotlin
   val span = tracer.buildSpan("<SPAN_NAME1>").start()
   try {
     val scope = tracer.activateSpan(span)
     scope.use {
          // Do something ...
          // ...
          // Start a new Scope
          val childSpan = tracer.buildSpan("<SPAN_NAME2>").start()          
          try {
            tracer.activateSpan(childSpan).use {
               // Do something ...
            }  
          }
          catch(e:Error){
            childSpan.error(e)
          }
          finally {
            childSpan.finish()
          }
      }
   }
   catch(e:Error){
     span.error(e)
   }
   finally {
     span.finish()
   }

   ```
7. To use scopes in asynchronous calls:
   ```kotlin
   val span = tracer.buildSpan("<SPAN_NAME1>").start()
   try{
     val scope = tracer.activateSpan(span)
     scope.use {
        // Do something ...
        doAsynWork {
          // Step 2: reactivate the Span in the worker thread
           val scopeContinuation = tracer.scopeManager().activate(span)
           scopeContinuation.use {
              // Do something ...
           }
        }
      }   
   }
   catch(e:Error){
     span.error(e)
   }
   finally{
     span.finish()
   }

   ```  
8. (Optional) To manually distribute traces between your environments, for example frontend to backend:

   * Step 1: Inject tracer context in the client request.

   ```kotlin
   val tracer = GlobalTracer.get()
   val span = tracer.buildSpan("<SPAN_NAME>").start()
   val tracedRequestBuilder = Request.Builder()
   tracer.inject(
           span.context(),
           Format.Builtin.TEXT_MAP_INJECT,
           TextMapInject { key, value ->
               tracedRequestBuilder.addHeader(key, value)
           }
   )
    val request = tracedRequestBuilder.build()
    // Dispatch the request and finish the span after.
   ```

   * Step 2: Extract the client tracer context from headers in server code.

   ```kotlin
   val extractedContext = GlobalTracer.get()
        .extract(
            Format.Builtin.TEXT_MAP_EXTRACT,
            TextMapExtract {
                request.headers()
                    .toMultimap()
                    .map { it.key to it.value.joinToString(";") }
                    .toMap()
                    .toMutableMap()
                    .iterator()
            }
        )
   val serverSpan = tracer.buildSpan("<SERVER_SPAN_NAME>").asChildOf(extractedContext).start()      

   ```

**Note**: For code bases using the OkHttp client, Datadog provides the implementation below.

9. (Optional) To provide additional tags alongside your span:

    ```kotlin
    span.setTag("http.url", url)
    ```
10. (Optional) To mark a span as having an error, log it using OpenTracing tags:

    ```kotlin
    span.log(mapOf(Fields.ERROR_OBJECT to throwable))
    ```
    ```kotlin
    span.log(mapOf(Fields.MESSAGE to errorMessage))
    ```
    You can also use one of the following helper method in AndroidTracer

    ```kotlin
    AndroidTracer.logThrowable(span, throwable)
    ```
    ```kotlin
    AndroidTracer.logErrorMessage(span, message)
    ```

## Integrations

In addition to manual tracing, the `dd-sdk-android` library provides the following integration.

### OkHttp

If you want to trace your OkHttp requests, you can add the provided [Interceptor][6] as follows:

```kotlin
val okHttpClient =  OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(
        DatadogInterceptor(
            listOf("example.com", "example.eu")
        )
    )
    .build()
```

This creates a span around each request processed by the OkHttpClient (matching the provided hosts), with all the relevant information automatically filled (URL, method, status code, error), and propagates the tracing information to your backend to get a unified trace within Datadog.

The interceptor tracks requests at the application level. You can also add a `TracingInterceptor` at the network level to get more details, for example when following redirections.

 ```kotlin
val tracedHosts = listOf("example.com", "example.eu")
val okHttpClient =  OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .addInterceptor(DatadogInterceptor(tracedHosts))
    .addNetworkInterceptor(TracingInterceptor(tracedHosts))
    .build()
 ```

Because the way the OkHttp Request is executed (using a Thread pool), the request span won't be automatically linked with the span that triggered the request. You can manually provide a parent span in the `OkHttp Request.Builder` as follows:

```kotlin
val request = Request.Builder()
              .url(requestUrl)
              .tag(Span::class.java, parentSpan)
              .build()
```

or if you are using the extensions provided in the `dd-sdk-android-ktx` library:

```kotlin
val request = Request.Builder()
              .url(requestUrl)
              .parentSpan(parentSpan)
              .build()
```

**Note**: If you use multiple Interceptors, this one must be called first.

## Batch collection

All the spans are first stored on the local device in batches. Each batch follows the intake specification. They are sent as soon as network is available, and the battery is high enough to ensure the Datadog SDK does not impact the end user's experience. If the network is not available while your application is in the foreground, or if an upload of data fails, the batch is kept until it can be sent successfully.

This means that even if users open your application while being offline, no data will be lost.

The data on disk will automatically be discarded if it gets too old to ensure the SDK doesn't use too much disk space.
