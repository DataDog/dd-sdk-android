# Android Trace Collection

<div class="alert alert-info">The Android trace collection is in public beta, and is currently not supported by Datadog.</div>

Send [Real User Monitoring data][1] to Datadog from your Android applications with [Datadog's `dd-sdk-android` client-side RUM library][2] and leverage the following features:

* get a global idea about your appâ€™s performance and demographics;
* understand which resources are the slowest;
* analyze errors by OS and device type.

**Note**: RUM on Android is still experimental, and will be available in the `dd-sdk-android` library version `1.5.0` or higher. The `dd-sdk-android` library supports all Android versions from API level 19 (Kit-Kat).

## Setup

1. Add the Gradle dependency by declaring the library as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```conf
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/datadog/datadog-maven" }
    }

    dependencies {
        implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android:x.x.x"
    }
    ```

2. Initialize the library with your application context and your [Datadog client token][4]. For security reasons, you must use a client token: you cannot use [Datadog API keys][5] to configure the `dd-sdk-android` library as they would be exposed client-side in the Android application APK byte code. For more information about setting up a client token, see the [client token documentation][4]. You also need to provide an Application ID (see our [RUM Getting Started page][7]).

    {{< tabs >}}
    {{% tab "US" %}}

```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        val config = DatadogConfig.Builder(BuildConfig.DD_CLIENT_TOKEN, BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID)
                        .trackGestures()
                        .useViewTrackingStrategy(strategy)
                        .build()
        Datadog.initialize(this, config)
    }
}
```

    {{% /tab %}}
    {{% tab "EU" %}}

```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        val config = DatadogConfig.Builder(BuildConfig.DD_CLIENT_TOKEN, BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID)
                                             .trackGestures()
                                             .useViewTrackingStrategy(strategy)
                        .useEUEndpoints()
                        .build()
        Datadog.initialize(this, config)
    }
}
```

    {{% /tab %}}
    {{< /tabs >}}
    
Depending on your application's architecture, you can choose one of several implementations of ViewTrackingStrategy :
 
 - ActivityViewTrackingStrategy: every Activity in your application is considered a distinct View;
 - FragmentViewTrackingStrategy: every Fragment in your application is considered a distinct View;
 - NavigationViewTrackingStrategy: if you use the Android Jetpack Navigation library, this is the recommended strategy. It will automatically track Navigation destination as a distinct View;

3. Configure and register the Rum Monitor. You only need to do it once, usually in your application's `onCreate()` method:

    ```kotlin
    val monitor = RumMonitor.Builder().build()
    GlobalRum.registerIfAbsent(monitor)
    ```
   
4. If you want to track your OkHttp requests as resources, you can add the provided [Interceptor][6] as follow:

    ```kotlin
    val okHttpClient =  OkHttpClient.Builder()
        .addInterceptor(DatadogRumMonitor())
        .build()
    ```

    This will create a RUM resource data around each request processed by the OkHttpClient, with all the relevant information automatically filled (url, method, status code, error).

    **Note**: If you use multiple Interceptors, this one must be called first.
