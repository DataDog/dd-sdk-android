# Datadog Integration for RxJava

## Getting Started 

To include the Datadog integration for [RxJava][1] in your project, simply add the
following to your application's `build.gradle` file.

```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/datadog/datadog-maven" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android:<latest-version>"
    implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android-rx:<latest-version>"
}
```

### Initial Setup

Before you can use the SDK, you need to setup the library with your application
context, your Client token and your Application ID. 
To generate a Client token and an Application ID please check **UX Monitoring > RUM Applications > New Application**
in the Datadog dashboard.

```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()

        val config = DatadogConfig.Builder("<CLIENT_TOKEN>", "<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>", "<APPLICATION_ID>").build()
        Datadog.initialize(this, config)

        val monitor = RumMonitor.Builder().build()
        GlobalRum.registerIfAbsent(monitor)
    }
}
```

Following RxJava's [Generated API documentation][2], you just have to apply the `doOnError` operator on your `Observable`,
`Flowable`, `Single`, `Maybe` or `Completable` and pass an instance of `DatadogErrorConsumer`.

Doing so will automatically intercept any Exception thrown in the upper stream by creating RUM Error events.

**Note** : If you are using `Kotlin` in your codebase you could also use the extension: `sendErrorToDatadog()`.

Java: 

```java
    Observable.create<T>{...}
    .doOnError(new DatadogErrorConsumer())
    ...
```

Kotlin: 

```java
    Observable.create<T>{...}
    .publishErrorsToRum()
    ...
```
