# Datadog Integration for Timber

## Getting Started 

To include the Datadog integration for Timber in your project, simply add the
following to your application's `build.gradle` file.

```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/datadog/datadog-maven" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android:<latest-version>"
    implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android-timber:<latest-version>"
}
```

### Initial Setup

Before you can use the SDK, you need to setup the library with your application
context and your API token. You can create a token from the Integrations > API
in Datadog. **Make sure you create a key of type `Client Token`.**

Once Datadog is initialized, you can then create a `Logger` instance using the
dedicated builder, and integrate it in Timber, as follows: 

```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        val config = DatadogConfig.Builder(BuildConfig.DD_CLIENT_TOKEN).build()
        Datadog.initialize(this, config)

        val logger = Logger.Builder()
                .setNetworkInfoEnabled(true)
                .setLogcatLogsEnabled(true)
                .setDatadogLogsEnabled(true)
                .build();
        Timber.plant(DatadogTree(logger))
    }
}
```

That's it, now all your Timber logs will be sent to Datadog automatically.

You can configure the logger's tags and attributes, as explained in the  [Datadog Android log collection documentation](http://docs.datadoghq.com/logs/log_collection/android)
