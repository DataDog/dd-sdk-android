# Datadog Integration for SQLDelight

## Getting Started 

To include the Datadog integration for [SQLDelight][1] in your project, simply add the
following to your application's `build.gradle` file.

```
repositories {
    maven { url "https://dl.bintray.com/datadog/datadog-maven" }
}

dependencies {
    implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android:<latest-version>"
    implementation "com.datadoghq:dd-sdk-android-sqldelight:<latest-version>"
}
```

### Initial Setup

Before you can use the SDK, you need to setup the library with your application
context, your Client token and your Application ID.
To generate a Client token and an Application ID please check **UX Monitoring > RUM Applications > New Application**
in the Datadog dashboard.

```kotlin
class SampleApplication : Application() {

    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        val config = DatadogConfig.Builder("<CLIENT_TOKEN>", "<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>", "<APPLICATION_ID>").build()
        Datadog.initialize(this, config)

        GlobalRum.registerIfAbsent(RumMonitor.Builder().build())
    }
}
```

Following SQLDelight's [Generated API documentation][1], you just have to provide the `DatadogSqliteCallback` in the 
`AndroidSqliteDriver` constructor.

Doing this detects whenever a database is corrupted and sends a relevant
RUM error event for it.

```kotlin
    val database = YourDatabase(
                AndroidSqliteDriver(
                    YourDatabase.Schema,
                    context,
                    callback = DatadogSqliteCallback(YourDatabase.Schema)
                ))
```

### Extension methods for traced transactions

If you are using SQLDelight transactions, you can trace the transaction block using the following 2 methods:

```kotlin
    database.yourQuery.transactionTraced("<SPAN_NAME>", noEnclosing){    
        // …
    }
```

```kotlin
    val result = database.yourQuery.transactionTracedWithResult("<SPAN_NAME>", noEnclosing){    
        // …
    }
```

They behave as the default methods (`transaction(noEnclosing,block)`, `transactionWithResult(noEnclosing,block`) and they simply require a span name as an 
extra argument.
