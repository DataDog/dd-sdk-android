 * Defines the dimension and positions in Global coordinates for a geometry. By Global we mean that

 * These dimensions are already normalized according with the current device screen density.
 * Example: if a device has a DPI = 2, the value of the dimension or position is divided by 2 to get
 * a normalized value.
 * @param x as the position on X axis
 * @param y as the position on Y axis
 * @param width as the width
